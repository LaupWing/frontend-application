# Risico Indicator
> Vue.js code based project
## Introduction
For this project we have to improve the Jeugdhulp Risico indicator(jri) app. This web app was built for the social workers to calculate the chance of the youth of being placed into a foster care. The actual app right work but isnt easy to navigate through. Click in the [link](http://174.138.1.153/kindveiligthuis) for the web app. We have to change this app by the framework of our choice to make it easier for the social worker to fill in the data.
